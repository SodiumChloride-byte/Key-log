Keylogger with Telegram Integration - Technical Report
Executive Summary

This report documents the development of a keylogger tool designed for ethical penetration testing purposes. The tool captures keystrokes and transmits them to a pre-configured Telegram chat at regular intervals. It includes improved security measures, error handling, and a professional documentation structure that clearly emphasizes its intended use for authorized security assessments only.

# Project Overview
## Purpose
The keylogger was developed as a technical demonstration for authorized penetration testing and security research. Its purpose is to simulate real-world keylogging threats in controlled environments to:
1. Test endpoint detection capabilities
2. Assess physical security controls
3. Validate incident response procedures
4. Evaluate user awareness training effectiveness

## Key Features
1. Real-time keystroke capture using pynput library
2. Secure transmission via Telegram Bot API
3. Configurable reporting intervals
4. Local buffering with automatic cleanup
5. Special key recognition (Enter, Tab, Backspace, etc.)
6. Size-limited transmissions to comply with platform restrictions
7. Multi-threaded architecture for non-blocking operation
8. Graceful shutdown with ESC key

# Technical Implementation
## Architecture

The solution follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:
1. Main Keylogger Module (keylogger.py) - Primary logic and execution
2. Configuration Module (config.py) - All configurable parameters
3. Requirements File (requirements.txt) - Dependency management
4. Documentation (README.md, LICENSE) - Usage instructions and legal disclaimers

## Core Components
1. Key Capture System
   * Leverages pynput.keyboard.Listener for cross-platform compatibility
   * Maintains a thread-safe buffer of captured keystrokes
   * Translates special keys to human-readable format
   * Implements automatic buffer management to prevent memory issues

2. Transmission Engine
   * Communicates with Telegram Bot API over HTTPS
   * Bundles captured keystrokes into structured messages
   * Implements automatic retry logic for failed transmissions
   * Respects platform message size limitations

3. Configuration Management
   * Centralized configuration in config.py
   * Clear parameter documentation
   * Sensible default values
   * Validation at startup

4. Security Consideration
   * Local log files automatically purged after successful transmission
   * No plaintext credentials stored in version control
   * Proper process cleanup on termination
   * Clear legal disclaimers in multiple locations

## Dependencies
   * pynput (1.7.6): Cross-platform input monitoring
   * requests (2.31.0): HTTP client for API communication

# Security and Compliance
## Legal Framework
All components include explicit disclaimers restricting usage to authorized penetration testing only. Users must:
   * Obtain explicit written permission from system owners
   * Comply with applicable local and international privacy laws
   * Follow responsible disclosure practices
   * Limit usage to controlled assessment environments

## Risk Mitigation
   * Data Minimization: Logs deleted immediately after successful transmission
   * Access Controls: Configuration credentials required for operation
   * Visibility: Obvious termination key (ESC) for immediate stopping
   * Audit Trail: All transmissions timestamped with system time

# Testing and Validation
## Functional Testing
   * Key capture accuracy across character sets and special keys
   * Network resilience under varying connectivity conditions
   * Buffer management under high-frequency input
   * Proper cleanup on both manual and automatic termination

## Security Testing
   * Credential handling within configuration files
   * Temporary file management and cleanup
   * Error state handling (invalid configuration, API failures)
   * Memory management and leak prevention

## Performance Testing
   * Resource utilization under standard operation
   * Startup and shutdown time measurements
   * Network usage pattern analysis
   * Cross-platform compatibility verification

# Deployment Instructions
## Prerequisites
   * Python 3.7 or higher
   * Valid Telegram account
   * Internet connectivity
   * Authorization for target system

## Setup Process
   * Create Telegram bot using BotFather
   * Obtain API token and user/chat ID
   * Clone repository and install dependencies
   * Configure config.py with credentials
   * Execute keylogger with Python interpreter

## Operational Security
   * Run only in isolated assessment environments
   * Disable after completion of authorized testing
   * Ensure no unauthorized data transmission occurs
   * Validate all captured information is properly sanitized

# Findings and Recommendations
## Technical Assessment
The tool provides effective simulation of basic keylogging attacks. Its modular design makes it easy to extend with additional features. However, advanced evasion techniques or encryption capabilities are not included in this version.

## Recommendations for Improvement
   * Add optional encryption for locally stored logs
   * Implement heartbeat functionality for persistent operation verification
   * Develop cross-platform executable packaging
   * Extend to mouse movement and click capture capabilities
   * Create dashboard interface for centralized monitoring
   * Add capability to capture screenshots at defined intervals
   * Implement obfuscation techniques for advanced testing scenarios

## Ethical Usage Guidelines
   * Only deploy with explicit, documented authorization
   * Maintain detailed logs of all testing activities
   * Immediately report any accidental data exposure
   * Regularly update dependencies to prevent exploitation
   * Ensure tool access is restricted to authorized personnel
   * Implement time-based auto-shutdown for additional safety
   * Include version information in transmitted reports for audit purposes

# Conclusion

This keylogger project successfully demonstrates the fundamental mechanics of keystroke capture and remote transmission within a controlled, documented framework. The implementation includes appropriate safeguards and clear usage restrictions that align with ethical penetration testing practices.

The tool serves as a valuable educational resource for understanding keylogging threats and testing defensive measures. Its design encourages responsible security research while maintaining functionality relevant to professional penetration testing scenarios.

By emphasizing proper authorization, clear documentation, and safe practices, this project contributes to the cybersecurity community's understanding of these threats in a constructive and controlled manner.
